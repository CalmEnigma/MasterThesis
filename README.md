This thesis explores the relationship between US firmsâ€™ stock price informativeness
and the number of US public companies belonging to their same primary industry. The
study is conducted on an unbalanced panel of 94,714 firm-year observations over the
period from 1976 to 2016. Using an extended FERC methodology with fixed effects, I
find that the association between price informativeness and industry listing counts is
insignificantly negative in my main specification. Furthermore, the inverse relationship
becomes statistically significant in recent years and across a couple of robustness checks.
Taken at face value, the non-positive results suggest that the informativeness of most
US stock prices may not have suffered from their having fewer listed industry peers
in the last two-and-a-half decades. Additionally, the persistently negative coefficients
hint that investors may be employing intra-industry information improperly, especially
in more recent times for firms with high market-to-book ratios.
